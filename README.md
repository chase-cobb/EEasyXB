# EEasyXB
EEasyXB is a C++ wrapper that provides an easy to use API for reading and/or modifying the EEPROM contents of the Original Xbox from any application. This is meant to be used with NXDK.

#### Documentation
All documentation is available in the "Docs" directory. If you notice any issues with the documentation, please let me know and I will make sure it gets resolved.

#### Examples
Inside the "Examples" directory, there are multiple examples showing how simple EEasyXB is to integrate into existing applications, as well as providing sample code showing how to interact with the API.

#### Special Thanks
